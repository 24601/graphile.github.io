### How to contribute

<div style={{maxWidth: '48rem', margin: '0 auto'}}>

The PostGraphile and Graphile Engine projects wouldnâ€™t be where they are today without the people who supported them by dedicating their time, skills and knowledge to them since their inception in 2016.

There is always something for anyone who wants to get involved to work on; be it programming, writing, organising meetups or more. We are working hard to build an inclusive community around our open source projects, and would love for more interested people to join.

Here are some ways you can support us:

Customisability and extensibility are at the heart of PostGraphile and Graphile Engine. An easy way to get started with code contributions is to write your own plugins to add to the project's functionality.

Adding to the documentation is always a valuable way to contribute to the project. This will help you learn, and will teach other users too. Look for issues tagged 'Add to Docs' as a way to start.

### Next section?

Users are not legally required to give back to the PostGraphile project, but
it is in their interest to do so.

By significantly reducing the amount of work needed to achieve business goals
and reducing running costs, PostGraphile results in huge time and money
savings for users. We encourage organizations to contribute a portion of
these savings back, enabling the project to advance more rapidly, and result
in even greater savings for your organization.
