## About PostGraphile and Graphile Engine

PostGraphile exposes the powerful next generation features of PostgreSQL, enabling developers to use their existing PostgreSQL knowledge to build a secure and highly performant GraphQL API with just one command line. PostGraphile encourages developers to embrace the powerful features of PostgreSQL, the most advanced open source database, rather than trust and learn a new set of tools and interfaces.

Before commencing work on [PostGraphile Version 4](/news/postgraphile-version-4/), every issue in the PostGraphile bug tracker was reviewd, and it was discovered that a rigid once-size-fits all GraphQL API was too restrictive: it resulted in users having to resort to forking the project or using workarounds such as schema stitching to add their desired functionality. With this in mind PostGraphile became a modular project, with its GraphQL generation powered by a new plugin-based project named Graphile Engine. Users can now add new functionality to their GraphQL schema without requiring modifications to the core PostGraphile software by using or developing Graphile Engine plugins. This negates the user's need to maintain their own forks of PostGraphile and leads to a smoother and more seamless GraphQL experience.

## PostGraphile and Graphile Engine logos

The Graphile Engine logo is a red angular heart. The PostGraphile logo is a fierce blue elephant, a mesh between the blue Postgres elephant logo and the Graphile red heart.
