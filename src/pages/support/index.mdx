## Standard Support Plan

Our standard support plan gives your team access to the knowledge and

incoming support request:

- critical: 1 business day
- serious: 1.5 business days
- moderate: 2 business days
- minor: 5 business days

Support time is capped at 4 hours per month, after which additional support
is available for an hourly rate.

Cost: $250/mo (+ VAT where applicable)

## Budget Support Plan

Our budget support plan is highly competetive and easy to understand: it's
half the cost of the standard plan, is capped at half the hours, and has
double the response times. It's particularly suitable for solo founders,
pre-revenue startups and non-profits.

- critical: 2 business day
- serious: 3 business days
- moderate: 4 business days
- minor: 10 business days

Support time is capped at 2 hours per month, after which additional support
is available for an hourly rate.

Cost: $125/mo (+ VAT where applicable)
