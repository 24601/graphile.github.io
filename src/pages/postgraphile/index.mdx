### Rapidly develop lightning-fast powerful applications

<big>PostGraphile automatically detects tables, columns, indexes, relationships,
views, types, functions, comments, and more &mdash; providing a GraphQL server that
is highly intelligent about your data, and that automatically updates itself
without restarting when you modify your database.</big>

  Thanks for making GraphQL something I can use on my project in a robust way
  with <strong>minimal effort</strong>. 500-1500 requests per second on a
  single server is pretty awesome.

  This project, Benjie's handling of it, the docs, support, and community is
  awesome all around. <strong>PostGraphile is a powerful, idomatic, and elegant
  tool.</strong>

  Recently I launched a few mobile and web apps using GraphQL, Great stuff, not
  least thanks to wonderful PostGraphile and Apollo. <strong>At this point,
  itâ€™s quite hard for me to come back and enjoy working with
  REST.</strong>

  I setup my backend to use PostGraphile directly when querying the local
  database. It's removed a bunch of hand-written SQL, added type-safety to
  verify Postgres schema compatibility, and <strong>created a more consistent
  dev experience for frontend/backend code.</strong>

  Our company is under going a technology shift to use more a more modern
  stack. A large piece of this shift is our desire to use a GraphQL interface
  to our Postgres server. After researchiing we decided to try Postgraphile
  from the graphile.org site and <strong>we couldn't be happier</strong>.
  It's very expansive and configurable and the maintainers are available to
  ask questions and it's nice to see such an active group fixing bugs and
  adding enhancements. We're very happy with our choice!
