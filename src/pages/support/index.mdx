## Budget Support Plan

Our budget support plan is highly competitive and easy to understand: it's
half the price of the standard plan, is capped at half the hours, and has
double the response times. It's particularly suitable for solo founders,
pre-revenue startups and non-profits.

Support time is capped at 2 hours per month, after which additional support
is available for an hourly rate.

Price: $125/mo (+ VAT where applicable)

## FAQ

### What are the response times? 

Response times are guaranteed based on the severity of the
incoming support request:

- **critical**: 1 business day
- **serious**: 1.5 business days
- **moderate**: 2 business days
- **minor**: 5 business days

For the budget plans, response times are doubled:

- **critical**: 2 business day
- **serious**: 3 business days
- **moderate**: 4 business days
- **minor**: 10 business days

### How is severity classified?

We classify the severity of incoming support requests according to these classes:

- **critical**: the Software is inoperable or a core function of the Software is unavailable or a critical security vulnerability in the Software is discovered;
- **serious**: a core function of the Software is significantly impaired;
- **moderate**: a core function of the Software is impaired, where the impairment does not constitute a serious issue; or a non-core function of the Software is significantly impaired; and
- **minor**: any impairment of the Software not falling into the above categories; and any cosmetic issue affecting the Software or its documentation.

### Does the support plan cover large/complex deployments, and multi-stage QA pipelines?

The advertised fee is not affected by how you deploy, or how many development
environments you have. However, you should note that the support plan
covers issues with the Graphile suite only, it does not cover external concerns such as
your servers, routing, proxying and deployment — we cannot help you debug your
Kubernetes cluster, or help spot an issue in your nginx config.

### Do support hours rollover from month to month?

No; you are not paying for "support hours," you are paying for access to
support within a guaranteed timeframe if you hit a bug in the Graphile
software, or an issue with your use of PostGraphile where the solution is not
well documented. We're a small open source company with limited resources, so
we must apply a cap to the hours we can spend helping you so that we can
honour our other responsibilities. In normal situations you should never come
near to this cap, since we can answer most queries rapidly.

### What kind of things can the support be used for?

The main use case for Graphile support is that if you hit a bug in
PostGraphile or the Graphile suite of tools, we can help you to understand it, and advise you on how to work
around the issue until a fix is available. Given PostGraphile's MIT license
(which disclaims all liabilities), having the guarantee of a rapid response
to production issues you may face is the main value proposition of the
support plan.

A secondary use case is if the documentation is unclear or
lacking in a particular area, we can prioritise fixing it, and can provide
you with a solution/explanation in the interim.

Experimental features of PostGraphile (these are marked with 'experimental'
or 'EXPERIMENTAL' in the documentation) are not officially covered under the
support agreement, but if we're able we will try and help you with these
also.

Support requests **cannot** be used:

- for general consulting,
- for brainstorming,
- for development of new features or plugins.

✨NEW✨The Standard Plan now includes 3 x 30 minute screensharing calls each month, which can be used in a more flexible way, and allows for important one-on-one time with the maintainer of the PostGraphile software. Calls work best when you come to them with a planned list of discussion points, and these can include more general queries and advice.

Should you require longer consulting hours or developing of new features and plugins, we have other options such as [one-on-one
ad-hoc consulting](https://www.supersaas.co.uk/schedule/Benjie/One_on_One) or
longer consulting and/or software development contracts. Please [get in
touch](mailto:team@graphile.com?subject=Support%20enquiry) for more
information.

### What other benefits does a support plan give me?

On [our Discord chat](http://discord.gg/graphile), members are given coloured
name badges if they support PostGraphile in some way (sponsorship, support
plan, etc). Unofficially, we can allocate more time to helping these
members with coloured name badges.
