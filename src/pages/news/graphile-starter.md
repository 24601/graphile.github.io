_Announced 2019-12-03_

<p class='intro'>
The team behind Graphile are excited to release Graphile Starter - an opinionated quick-start project for full-stack application development in React, Node.js, GraphQL and PostgreSQL. It includes the foundations of a modern web application, with a full user registration system, session management, optimised job queue, a significant amount of pre-configured tooling, tests and much more.
</p>

Graphile Starter is designed for client projects, hack days, side hustles, SaaS projects, and many other uses we haven't even thought of yet. The boilerplate for a React, GraphQL and Postgres stack is already there, just add your idea and you're ready to go.
