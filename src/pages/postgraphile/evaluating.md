## Evaluating PostGraphile For Your Project

Hopefully youâ€™ve been convinced that PostGraphile serves an awesome GraphQL API,
but now letâ€™s take a more critical look at whether or not you should adopt
PostGraphile for your project.

PostGraphileâ€™s audience is for people whose core business is not the API and
want to prioritize their product. PostGraphile allows you to define your content
model in the database as you normally would, however instead of building the
bindings to the database (your API) PostGraphile takes care of it.

This takes a huge maintenance burden off your shoulders. Now you donâ€™t have to
worry about optimizing the API and the database, instead you can focus on just
optimizing your database.

### No Lock In

PostGraphile does not lock you into using PostGraphile forever. Its purpose is to
help your business in a transitory period. When you feel comfortable with the
cost of building your API PostGraphile is simple to switch with a custom
solution.

How is it simple? Well first of all, your PostgreSQL schema is still your
PostgreSQL schema. PostGraphile does not ask you to do anything too divergent
with your schema allowing you to take your schema (and all your data) to
whatever solution you build next. GraphQL itself provides a simple and clear
deprecation path if you want to start using different fields. And of course
with Graphile Build plugins you can extend (or remove) functionality as you
wish.

Ideally PostGraphile scales with your company and we would appreciate your
contributions to help it scale, however there is a simple exit path even years
into the business.

### Schema Driven APIs

If you fundamentally disagree with a one-to-one mapping of a SQL schema to an
API (GraphQL or otherwise) this section is for you. First of all, PostGraphile
is not necessarily meant to be a permanent solution. PostGraphile was created to
allow you to focus on your product and not the API. If you want a custom API
there is a simple transition path (read [no lock in](#no-lock-in)). If you
still canâ€™t get over the one-to-one nature of PostGraphile consider the
following arguments why putting your business logic in PostgreSQL is a good
idea:

1. PostgreSQL already has a powerful [user management system][user-management] with fine grained [row level security][row-level-security]. A custom API would mean you have to build your own user management and security.
2. PostgreSQL allows you to hide implementation details with [views][pg-views] of your data. Simple views can even be [auto-updatable][pg-udpatable-views]. This provides you with the same freedom and flexibility as you might want from a custom API except more performant.
3. PostgreSQL gives you automatic relations with the `REFERENCES` constraint and PostGraphile automatically detects them. With a custom API, youâ€™d need to hardcode these relationships.
4. For what itâ€™s worth, you can write in your favorite scripting language in PostgreSQL including [JavaScript][js-in-pg] and [Ruby][ruby-in-pg].
5. And if you donâ€™t want to write your code inside PostgreSQL, you could also use PostgreSQLâ€™s [`NOTIFY`][pg-notify] feature to fire events to a listening Ruby or [JavaScript][node-pg-notify] microservice can listen and respond to PostgreSQL events (this could include email transactions and event reporting); or add a plugin via Graphile Build to wrap or even replace a PostGraphile resolver.

Still worried about a certain aspect of a schema driven API? Open an issue, we're confident we can convince you otherwise ðŸ˜‰
