PostGraphQL was originally written and maintained by
[@calebmer](https://twitter.com/calebmer) — v1.0.1 was released on 23rd April
2016 with the
[first contribution from the community](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/commit/a0b7e3165bd6fc046d7a052f3c1cbcd029db4870)
that same month.

[Version 2](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/releases/tag/v2.0.0) was
released in October 2016 and brought many enhancements including introducing the
well-loved CLI and JWT generating functionality.

[Version 3](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/releases/tag/v3.0.0) was
released in February 2017 and introduced automatic schema exporting (in both
GraphQL and JSON formats), schema watching, and changed the default global node
identifier from `__id` to `nodeId`.

During the second quarter of 2017 Caleb handed the reins over to
[@Benjie](https://twitter.com/benjie) who became the primary maintainer of
PostGraphQL whilst Caleb transitioned to Facebook with a new mission: to make
[Flow](https://flow.org/) the best static type-checker for JavaScript.

[Version 4](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/pull/506) replaced 80% of
the codebase with the new Graphile Engine core, focussing on lower latency,
higher performance and greater extensibility whilst maintaining as much
compatibility with version 3 as possible. Due to trademark concerns, version 4
also introduces a rename of the project from PostGraphQL to **PostGraphile**.

But version 4 is not the end of PostGraphile's history — there's lots more to
come...
