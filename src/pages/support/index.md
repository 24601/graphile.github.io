### Which repository do I report issues to?

If you know which file contains the issue, please report to the repository that
file belongs to.  If you're not sure and you're using PostGraphile then please
report via the [PostGraphile issue
tracker](https://github.com/postgraphql/postgraphql/issues), otherwise report
on the [Graphile Build issue
tracker](https://github.com/graphile/graphile-build/issues).

### There's a typo in...

We ❤️  typo fixes - and it's the easiest way for you to make your mark on the
project!  If the typo is in this website; please open a PR to [the graphile.github.io
repository](https://github.com/graphile/graphile.github.io). If the typo is in
one of the tools, please raise a pull request with the relevant repository (see
above).

Raising a pull request is super easy - you can edit a markdown file directly
through the GitHub interface - simply find the file in question and press the
Edit (pencil) button and follow the instructions.  If you're not comfortable
raising a pull request, feel free to raise the edit as an issue, but be aware
that it'll take longer to fix.

### How quickly can I expect a response?

Community support, offered via GitHub, can take anywhere from minutes to months
to get a response. In rare cases there's never a response at all. I'm very
grateful to the community for helping each other out, improving the
documentation and all the other work they help with.

For the professional services I aim to respond to all messages by the end of
the next working day (UK calendar); often it will be much sooner.

### Who are you?

I'm the primary maintainer of the Graphile suite of tools, [Benjie
Gillam](https://github.com/benjie). I've been writing JavaScript for 20 years,
PostgreSQL for 10 years and Node.js since early 2012. I've been helping people
with their PostGraphile/PostGraphQL issues since 2016.


### How do the professional services work?

Email me with a brief outline of what you need and I'll get back to you either
with an estimate of the cost of the work, a request for a call to discuss the
scope of the work, some alternative solutions you may not have considered, or
I might decline the work (for example if it's out of the scope of Graphile or
I do not have sufficient availability).


### Could you just add this one feature...?

Sure, [get in
touch](mailto:benjie@graphile.org?subject=Graphile%20Custom%20Work%20or%20Support)
and I'll try and estimate the cost of implementing the feature!
