## History

PostGraphQL was originally written and maintained by
[@calebmer](https://twitter.com/calebmer) — v1.0.1 was released on 23rd April
2016 with the [first contribution from the
community](https://github.com/postgraphql/postgraphql/commit/a0b7e3165bd6fc046d7a052f3c1cbcd029db4870)
that same month.

[Version 2](https://github.com/postgraphql/postgraphql/releases/tag/v2.0.0) was released
in October 2016 and brought many enhancements including introducing the
well-loved CLI and JWT generating functionality.

[Version 3](https://github.com/postgraphql/postgraphql/releases/tag/v3.0.0) was
released in February 2017 and introduced automatic schema exporting (in both
GraphQL and JSON formats), schema watching, and changed the default global node
identifier from `__id` to `nodeId`.

During the second quarter of 2017 [@Benjie](https://twitter.com/benjie) took
over as the maintainer of PostGraphQL whilst Caleb transitioned to Facebook
with a new mission: to make [Flow](https://flow.org/) the best static
type-checker for JavaScript. Benjie's focus for PostGraphQL is performance and
extensibility, and with that in mind...

[Version 4](https://github.com/postgraphql/postgraphql/pull/506) is a ground-up rewrite
focussed on higher performance (solving the N+1 issue by generating as few SQL
queries as possible) and extensibility (enabled by a new GraphQL plugin system). It
aims is to do this whilst maintaining as much compatibility with version 3 as
possible. Due to trademark concerns, version 4 also introduces a rename of the project
from PostGraphQL to **PostGraphile**.

But version 4 is not the end of PostGraphile's history — there's lots more to come...
